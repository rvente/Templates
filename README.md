# Templates
Here is where I intend on posting a bunch of my templates and configurations. You can find and understand the basics of writing documents in various markup languages

You need `make`,`pandoc`,`latex`, `xelatex`, `pdflatex` and`biber` to get it up and running you can usually get those packages by just installing `pandoc` which has `textlive` as a dependency.. From then, it's just as easy as running `make` in each of the respective directories. In each of the makefiles, I describe things to note when using each of the templates.
