# Templates

This repository provides a basis of for creating documents in various LaTeX and Pandoc-Flavored 5Markdown

You need `make`,`pandoc`,`latex`, `xelatex`, `pdflatex` and `biber` to get it up and running. You can usually get those packages by just installing `pandoc` which has `textlive` as a dependency. From then, it's just as easy as running `make` in each of the respective directories. In each of the makefiles, I describe things to note when using each of the templates.
